# Full stack open 2022
Here I will update my journey to Full-stack master!

The course that I'm doing is https://fullstackopen.com/en/, provided by [Helsinki University](https://www.helsinki.fi/en).

### Learning React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript in one go!

- This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript.
- The main focus is on building single-page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
- The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
- The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the application’s data.
